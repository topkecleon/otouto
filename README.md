# otouto
The plugin-wielding, multipurpose Telegram bot.

[Public Bot](http://telegram.me/mokubot) | [Official Channel](http://telegram.me/otouto) | [Development Group](http://telegram.me/BotDevelopment)

otouto is a plugin-based, IRC-style bot written for the [Telegram Bot API](http://core.telegram.org/bots/api). Originally written in February of 2015 as a set of Lua scripts to run on [telegram-cli](http://github.com/vysheng/tg), otouto was open-sourced and migrated to the bot API later in June that year.

## Setup
You _must_ have Lua (5.2+), luasocket, luasec, multipart-post, dkjson, and lua-utf8 (not needed if using Lua 5.3+) installed. You should also have lpeg, though it is not required. It is recommended you install these with LuaRocks.

To get started, clone the repository and set the following values in `config.lua`:

 - `bot_api_key` as your bot authorization token from the BotFather.
 - `admin` as your Telegram ID.

Optionally:

 - `lang` as the two-letter code representing your language.

Some plugins are not enabled by default. If you wish to enable them, add them to the `plugins` array.

When you are ready to start the bot, run `./launch.sh`. To stop the bot, send "/halt" through Telegram. If you terminate the bot manually, you risk data loss. If you do you not want the bot to restart automatically, run it with `lua main.lua`.

Note that certain plugins, such as translate.lua and greetings.lua, will require privacy mode to be disabled. Additionally, some plugins may require or make use of various API keys:

 - `bing.lua`: [Bing Search API](http://datamarket.azure.com/dataset/bing/search) key (`bing_api_key`)
 - `gImages.lua` & `youtube.lua`: Google [API](http://console.developers.google.com) and [CSE](https://cse.google.com/cse) keys (`google_api_key`, `google_cse_key`)
 - `weather.lua`: [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org) API key (`owm_api_key`)
 - `lastfm.lua`: [last.fm](http://last.fm/api) API key (`lastfm_api_key`)
 - `bible.lua`: [Biblia](http://api.biblia.com) API key (`biblia_api_key`)
 - `cats.lua`: [The Cat API](http://thecatapi.com) API key (optional) (`thecatapi_key`)
 - `apod.lua`: [NASA](http://api.nasa.gov) API key (`nasa_api_key`)
 - `translate.lua`: [Yandex](http://tech.yandex.com/keys/get) API key (`yandex_key`)
 - `chatter.lua`: [SimSimi](http://developer.simsimi.com/signUp) API key (`simsimi_key`)

## Control plugins
Some plugins are designed to be used by the bot's owner. Here are some examples, how they're used, and what they do.

| Plugin          | Command    | Function                                           |
|:----------------|:-----------|:---------------------------------------------------|
| `control.lua`   | /reload    | Reloads all plugins and configuration.             |
|                 | /halt      | Shuts down the bot after saving the database.      |
|                 | /script    | Runs a list a bot commands, separated by newlines. |
| `blacklist.lua` | /blacklist | Blocks people from using the bot.                  |
| `shell.lua`     | /run       | Executes shell commands on the host system.        |
| `luarun.lua`    | /lua       | Executes Lua commands in the bot's environment.    |

## Group Administration
The administration plugin enables self-hosted, single-realm group administration, supporting both normal groups and supergroups whch are owned by the bot owner. This works by sending TCP commands to an instance of tg running on the owner's account.

To get started, run `./tg-install.sh`. Note that this script is written for Ubuntu/Debian. If you're running Arch (the only acceptable alternative), you'll have to do it yourself. If that is the case, note that otouto uses the "test" branch of tg, and the AUR package `telegram-cli-git` will not be sufficient, as it does not have support for supergroups yet.

Once the installation is finished, enable the `administration` plugin in your config file. **The administration plugin must be loaded before the `about` and `blacklist` plugins.** You may have reason to change the default TCP port (4567); if that is the case, remember to change it in `tg-launch.sh` as well. Run `./tg-launch.sh` in a separate screen/tmux window. You'll have to enter your phone number and go through the login process the first time. The script is set to restart tg after two seconds, so you'll need to Ctrl+C after exiting.

While tg is running, you may start/reload otouto with `administration.lua` enabled, and have access to a wide variety of administrative commands and automata. The administration "database" is stored in `administration.json`. To start using otouto to administrate a group (note that you must be the owner (or an administrator)), send `/gadd` to that group. For a list of commands, use `/ahelp`. Below I'll describe various functions now available to you.

| 5 | antiflood   | Prevents flooding by rate-limiting messages per user.                            |
| 6 | antihammer  | Allows globally-banned users to enter a group.                                   |

#### antiflood
antiflood (flag 5) provides a system of automatic flood protection by removing users who post too much. It is entirely configurable by a group's governor, an administrator, or the bot owner. For each message to a particular group, a user is awarded a certain number of "points". The number of points is different for each message type. When the user reaches 100 points, he is removed. Points are reset each minute. In this way, if a user posts twenty messages within one minute, he is removed.

**Default antiflood values:**

| Type | Points |
|:-----|:------:|
| text     | 5  |
| contact  | 5  |
| audio    | 5  |
| voice    | 5  |
| photo    | 10 |
| document | 10 |
| location | 10 |
| video    | 10 |
| sticker  | 20 |

Additionally, antiflood can be configured to automatically ban a user after he has been automatically kicked from a single group a certain number of times in one day. This is configurable as the antiflood value `autoban` and is set to three by default.

## Plugins
otouto uses a robust plugin system, similar to yagop's [Telegram-Bot](http://github.com/yagop/telegram-bot).

Most plugins are intended for public use, but a few are for other purposes, like those for [use by the bot's owner](#control-plugins). See [here](#list-of-plugins) for a list of plugins.

There are five standard plugin components.

| Component  | Description                                          |
|:-----------|:-----------------------------------------------------|
| `action`   | Main function. Expects `msg` table as an argument.   |
| `triggers` | Table of triggers for the plugin. Uses Lua patterns. |
| `init`     | Optional function run when the plugin is loaded.     |
| `cron`     | Optional function to be called every minute.         |
| `command`  | Basic command and syntax. Listed in the help text.   |
| `doc`      | Usage for the plugin. Returned by "/help $command".  |
| `error`    | Plugin-specific error message; false for no message. |


No component is required, but some depend on others. For example, `action` will never be run if there's no `triggers`, and `doc` will never be seen if there's no `command`.

Return values from `action` are optional, but they do affect the flow. If it returns a table, that table will become `msg`, and `on_msg_receive` will continue with that. If it returns `true`, it will continue with the current `msg`.

When an action or cron function fails, the exception is caught and passed to the `handle_exception` utilty and is either printed to the console or send to the chat/channel defined in `log_chat` in config.lua.

Interactions with the bot API are straightforward. See the [Bindings section](#bindings) for details.

Several functions used in multiple plugins are defined in utilities.lua. Refer to that file for usage and documentation.

* * *

## Bindings
Calls to the Telegram bot API are performed with the `bindings.lua` file through the multipart-post library. otouto's bindings file supports all standard API methods and all arguments. Its main function, `bindings.request`, accepts four arguments: `self`, `method`, `parameters`, `file`. (At the very least, `self` should be a table containing `BASE_URL`, which is bot's API endpoint, ending with a slash, eg `https://api.telegram.org/bot123456789:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ987654321/`.)

`method` is the name of the API method. `parameters` (optional) is a table of key/value pairs of the method's parameters to be sent with the method. `file` (super-optional) is a table of a single key/value pair, where the key is the name of the parameter and the value is the filename (if these are included in `parameters` instead, otouto will attempt to send the filename as a file ID).

Additionally, any method can be called as a key in the `bindings` table (for example, `bindings.getMe`). The `bindings.gen` function (which is also the __index function in its metatable) will forward its arguments to `bindings.request` in their proper form. In this way, the following two function calls are equivalent:

```
bindings.request(
	self,
	'sendMessage',
	{
		chat_id = 987654321,
		text = 'Quick brown fox.',
		reply_to_message_id = 54321,
		disable_web_page_preview = false,
		parse_method = 'Markdown'
	}
)

bindings.sendMessage(
	self,
	{
		chat_id = 987654321,
		text = 'Quick brown fox.',
		reply_to_message_id = 54321,
		disable_web_page_preview = false,
		parse_method = 'Markdown'
	}
)
```

Furthermore, `utilities.lua` provides two "shortcut" functions to mimic the behavior of otouto's old bindings: `send_message` and `send_reply`. `send_message` accepts these arguments: `self`, `chat_id`, `text`, `disable_web_page_preview`, `reply_to_message_id`, `use_markdown`. The following function call is equivalent to the two above:

```
utilities.send_message(self, 987654321, 'Quick brown fox.', false, 54321, true)
```

Uploading a file for the `sendPhoto` method would look like this:

```
bindings.sendPhoto(self, { chat_id = 987654321 }, { photo = 'dankmeme.jpg' } )
```

and using `sendPhoto` with a file ID would look like this:

```
bindings.sendPhoto(self, { chat_id = 987654321, photo = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ123456789' } )
```

Upon success, bindings will return the deserialized result from the API. Upon failure, it will return false and the result. In the case of a connection error, it will return two false values. If an invalid method name is given, bindings will throw an exception. This is to mimic the behavior of more conventional bindings as well as to prevent "silent errors".

## Database
otouto doesn't use one. This isn't because of dedication to lightweightedness or some clever design choice. Interfacing with databases through Lua is never a simple, easy-to-learn process. As one of the goals of otouto is that it should be a bot which is easy to write plugins for, our approach to storing data is to treat our datastore like any ordinary Lua data structure. The "database" is a table accessible in the `database` value of the bot instance (usually `self.database`), and is saved as a JSON-encoded plaintext file each hour, or when the bot is told to halt. This way, keeping and interacting with persistent data is no different than interacting with a Lua table -- with one exception: Keys in tables used as associative arrays must not be numbers. If the index keys are too sparse, the JSON encoder/decoder will either change them to keys or throw an error.

Alone, the database will have this structure:

```
{
	users = {
		["55994550"] = {
			id = 55994550,
			first_name = "Drew",
			username = "topkecleon"
		}
	},
	userdata = {
		["55994550"] = {
			nickname = "Worst coder ever",
			lastfm = "topkecleon"
		}
	},
	version = "3.11"
}
```

`database.users` will store user information (usernames, IDs, etc) when the bot sees the user. Each table's key is the user's ID as a string.

`database.userdata` is meant to store miscellanea from various plugins.

`database.version` stores the last bot version that used it. This is to simplify migration to the next version of the bot an easy, automatic process.

Data from other plugins is usually saved in a table with the same name of that plugin. For example, administration.lua stores data in `database.administration`.

## Output style
otouto plugins should maintain a consistent visual style in their output. This provides a recognizable and comfortable user experience.

### Titles
Title lines should be **bold**, including any names and trailing punctuation (such as colons). The exception to this rule is if the title line includes a query, which should be _italic_. It is also acceptable to have a link somewhere inside a title, usually within parentheses. eg:

> **Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977)**
>
> **Search results for** _star wars_ **:**
>
> **Changelog for otouto (**[Github](http://github.com/topkecleon/otouto)**):**

### Lists
Numerated lists should be done with the number and its following punctuation bolded. Unnumbered lists should use the bullet character ( • ). eg:

> **1.** Life as a quick brown fox.
>
> **2.** The art of jumping over lazy dogs.

and

> • Life as a quick brown fox.
>
> • The art of jumping over lazy dogs.

### Links
Always name your links. Even then, use them with discretion. Excessive links make a post look messy. Links are reasonable when a user may want to learn more about something, but should be avoided when all desirable information is provided. One appropriate use of linking is to provide a preview of an image, as xkcd.lua and apod.lua do.

### Other Stuff
User IDs should appear within brackets, monospaced (`[123456789]`). Descriptions and information should be in plain text, but "flavor" text should be italic. The standard size for arbitrary lists (such as search results) is eight within a private conversation and four elsewhere. This is a trivial pair of numbers (leftover from the deprecated Google search API), but consistency is noticeable and desirable.
